Source code for the Minecraft mod "Beacon". 

How to add your mod:

Create a pull request of the "Mods to add.txt" file. Be sure to include the mod ID that you use for your mod,
the version of the mod, and the direct download link to that version of the mod. If you want to include an "alias"
for your mod (where Beacon will display *alias* + *version* instead of *modid* + *version*, you may include that as well.
