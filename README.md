# Beacon
Source code for the Minecraft mod "Beacon". 

What is Beacon? :

Beacon is a small new mod I have made. It automatically downloads any required mod(s) you are missing to join modded servers you have saved in your "servers" list. You can download **all** the mods needed to join every server you've saved, or just the ones you need to join a specific server.


How to add your mod:

Create a pull request of the "Mods to add.txt" file. Be sure to include the mod ID that you use for your mod,
the version of the mod, and the direct download link to that version of the mod. If you want to include an "alias"
for your mod (where Beacon will display *alias* + *version* instead of *modid* + *version*, you may include that as well.
